SERVICE OVERVIEW
Weather Ready provides Long range, date-specific weather forecasts for any date beyond the 14-day range of conventional short-term forecasts. Each forecast includes Expected maximum temperature, Chance of rainfall (as a percentage) and Estimated rainfall amount (in millimetres). Forecasts are currently only for the Perth metropolitan area. Purchased forecasts are static and reflect the best available data at the time of purchase.

SERVICE DELIVERY
Step 1: Visit the Forecast Page. Go to weatherready.com.au and click on “Get Forecast.”  
Step 2: Select Your Forecast Date. Use the calendar tool to choose the exact date you want weather information for. You can choose any future date beyond 14 days, including dates months or years ahead.  
Step 3: Enter Your Email Address. Enter a valid email address where your forecast will be sent. This is required to receive the forecast by email.  
Step 4: Proceed to Payment. Click “Proceed to Payment” to complete a secure payment through Stripe.  
Cost: $0.99 AUD per forecast  
Accepted Payment Methods: Credit/debit card, Apple Pay, Google Pay  
Security: Payments are processed securely by Stripe; Weather Ready does not store your payment details.  
After payment, you will be automatically redirected to the results page.  
Step 5: View and Receive Your Forecast. Immediately after payment, your forecast will be displayed on screen and also sent to your email address. If the email doesn't arrive within a few minutes check your spam/junk folder and add weatherreadyinfo@gmail.com to your email contacts.

FORECAST METHOD
Weather Ready uses a statistical-dynamical hybrid forecast model, which blends historical climate data for the selected date with recent real-world atmospheric conditions. The model is a probabilistic ensemble-style simulation that responds to current variability in the climate system. This model is not a physical weather model like ECMWF or ACCESS-G, and it does not use deterministic physics-based simulations. The model also does not simply return a long-term average. Instead, it generates a simulated forecast that reflects current trends while maintaining consistency with historical data patterns. Because the model is a probabilistic ensemble-style simulation, Weather Ready can theoretically generate forecasts for any future date but is limited by practical application.

FORECAST ACCURACY
Table 1: Forecast Accuracy Targets for Weather Ready Maximum Temperature Predictions  
This table shows the target accuracy levels for Weather Ready’s single-value daily maximum temperature forecasts. It presents the estimated probability that the actual max temperature will fall within a specified error margin (±°C) of the forecast on the target date. These are accuracy aims, not guarantees, based on historical model performance.  
Each row links a confidence level to an error range, helping users assess forecast reliability based on their required precision.

Confidence Level | Error Range (±°C)  
---------------- | ------------------  
20% | ±1.0°C  
39% | ±2.0°C  
54% | ±3.0°C  
67% | ±4.0°C  
76% | ±5.0°C  
84% | ±6.0°C  
89% | ±7.0°C  
92% | ±8.0°C  
95% | ±9.0°C  
96% | ±10.0°C  
99.99% | ±22.0°C

FORECAST BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
Each day, the temperature typically falls within a predictable range. This range is defined by two key factors: the historical mean maximum temperature for that specific calendar date, and the standard deviation, which reflects how much temperatures have typically varied around that mean in the past.  
These values are derived from long-term climate observations and exist because of stable, repeatable patterns in Earth’s physical systems.  
The Earth’s axial tilt and orbit around the Sun determine how much solar radiation (sunlight energy) reaches any given location on Earth throughout the year. This leads to seasonality, where solar input changes in a systematic, predictable way across the calendar.  
Because this seasonal cycle recurs at the same time each year, each day consistently receives a similar amount of solar energy. As a result, each calendar date has its own characteristic average maximum temperature.  
Although the solar input for each day is consistent from year to year, the actual temperature experienced on that day can vary due to local atmospheric and oceanic factors.  
These variations form a spread of possible temperatures around the average, and the standard deviation quantifies the width of this spread — in other words, how much day-to-day temperatures typically differ from the mean.  
Specific contributors to this temperature variability include:  
- Cloud cover  
- Wind direction  
- Passing weather systems  
- Ocean temperature fluctuations  
- Large-scale patterns like El Niño or La Niña  
- Humidity and overnight temperatures  

These factors vary from year to year, even on the same date, creating natural fluctuations in temperature.  
The degree to which these influences push temperatures above or below the historical mean is what generates the temperature variability — and is captured statistically by the standard deviation for that date.  
Weather Ready's long-range forecasts do not predict the occurrence of any specific influencing factors listed above.  
Instead, they provide predictions of the daily maximum temperature and the expected likelihood of rainfall for a chosen future date, using a model that simulates realistic day-to-day variation informed by historical data and current climate signals.
