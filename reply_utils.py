REFERENCE MATERIAL

SERVICE OVERVIEW
Weather Ready provides Long range, date-specific weather forecasts for any date beyond the 14-day range of conventional short-term forecasts. Each forecast includes Expected maximum temperature, Chance of rainfall (as a percentage) and Estimated rainfall amount (in millimetres). Forecasts are currently only for the Perth metropolitan area. Purchased forecasts are static and reflect the best available data at the time of purchase.

SERVICE DELIVERY
Step 1: Visit the Forecast Page. Go to weatherready.com.au and click on “Get Forecast.” 
Step 2: Select Your Forecast Date. Use the calendar tool to choose the exact date you want weather information for. You can choose any future date beyond 14 days, including dates months or years ahead.
Step 3: Enter Your Email Address. Enter a valid email address where your forecast will be sent. This is required to receive the forecast by email.
Step 4: Proceed to Payment. Click “Proceed to Payment” to complete a secure payment through Stripe.
Cost: $0.99 AUD per forecast
Accepted Payment Methods: Credit/debit card, Apple Pay, Google Pay
Security: Payments are processed securely by Stripe; Weather Ready does not store your payment details.
After payment, you will be automatically redirected to the results page.
Step 5: View and Receive Your Forecast. Immediately after payment, your forecast will be displayed on screen and also sent to your email address. If the email doesn't arrive within a few minutes check your spam/junk folder and add weatherreadyinfo@gmail.com to your email contacts

FORECAST METHOD
Weather Ready uses a statistical-dynamical hybrid model blending historical climate data with recent atmospheric conditions. It runs a probabilistic ensemble simulation that reflects current variability while aligning with historical patterns. Unlike physical models (e.g., ECMWF, ACCESS-G), it doesn’t use deterministic physics or return long-term averages. Instead, it simulates forecasts based on trends. Though capable of forecasting any future date, practical application limits this. 

FORECAST ACCURACY
This table outlines Weather Ready’s target accuracy for daily max temperature forecasts, showing the estimated chance that actual temps fall within specified error margins (±°C) on the forecast date. These are performance-based goals, not guarantees. Each row links a confidence level to its corresponding error range to help assess forecast reliability by required precision.
Confidence Level	Error Range (±°C)	Interpretation
20%	±1.0°C	20% chance the forecast is within ±1.0°C
39%	±2.0°C	39% chance the forecast is within ±2.0°C
54%	±3.0°C	54% chance the forecast is within ±3.0°C
67%	±4.0°C	67% chance the forecast is within ±4.0°C
76%	±5.0°C	76% chance the forecast is within ±5.0°C
84%	±6.0°C	84% chance the forecast is within ±6.0°C
89%	±7.0°C	89% chance the forecast is within ±7.0°C
92%	±8.0°C	92% chance the forecast is within ±8.0°C
95%	±9.0°C	95% chance the forecast is within ±9.0°C
96%	±10.0°C	96% chance the forecast is within ±10.0°C
99.99%	±22.0°C	Near certainty the forecast is within ±22.0°C

UNIQUE SELLING POINTS
Beyond 14 Days: Date-specific forecasts available for any future day.
Deterministic Outputs: Each forecast gives a precise max temperature, rainfall probability, and expected rainfall — not vague ensemble ranges.
No Seasonal Averages: Forecasts don’t default to long-term medians; each uses structured probabilistic methods to simulate daily values with realistic variability.
Perth-Focused: Locally calibrated forecasts tailored for the Perth metro area.
Custom Model: Uses a statistical-dynamical hybrid model, responsive to current climate variability and aligned with historical patterns.
Clear Daily Results: Provides one specific forecast per day.
Instant Delivery: Forecasts shown immediately and sent via email — no subscriptions, logins, or apps.
User-Friendly: Simple, clear presentation requiring no technical knowledge.
Advantage in Variability: Max temperature forecasts are most valuable during days with large deviations from historical averages.

FORECAST BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Each day’s temperature typically falls within a predictable range defined by the historical mean maximum for that calendar date and its standard deviation — both based on long-term climate data. These exist due to Earth’s stable physical patterns: axial tilt and orbit dictate solar radiation received at each location, creating a recurring seasonal cycle. Each date thus has a characteristic average maximum temperature.
While daily solar input is consistent year to year, actual temperatures vary due to local and global factors like cloud cover, wind, weather systems, ocean temperatures, El Niño/La Niña, humidity, and overnight temps. These cause natural fluctuations around the mean, with standard deviation quantifying that variability.
Weather Ready’s long-range forecasts don’t predict specific causes of variation. Instead, they simulate daily maximum temperatures and rainfall probabilities for future dates using historical variability and current climate signals to model realistic day-to-day outcomes.
