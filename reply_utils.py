FORECAST METHODOLOGY
For each YearDay, calculate the average maximum temperature (T_c).
Also calculate the standard deviation of maximum temperature across years (σ_c).
For each YearDay, calculate the average difference between the current days maximum temperature and the next days maximum temperature.
For each YearDay, calculate the standard deviation of differences between the current days maximum temperature and the next days maximum temperature. (σₚ).
For each YearDay, calculate the rainfall probability (P_r).
P_r is the proportion of YearDays across all years where rainfall was greater than 0 mm on days with a similar maximum temperature.
Calculate average rainfall amount (R_mm) on days where rainfall was greater than 0 mm
DATA PREPARATION
Store all climatological values in a structured reference table in Sheet1.
Include columns such as YearDay, AverageMaximum, StdDev (σ_c), ΔT, and σₚ.
Append new daily observations using Power Query or manual entry.
Ensure persistence and variability metrics update automatically as new data is added.
LINKING FORECAST DATE TO HISTORICAL DATA
In Sheet2, link the forecast date to its corresponding YearDay.
Pull all relevant climatological statistics dynamically from Sheet1.
INPUT HANDLING
Obtain the user-selected forecast date from the form input.
Identify the most recent completed day before the forecast date.
Retrieve the actual maximum temperature (Tₚ) for that day.
Retrieve the recent day-to-day temperature variability (σₚ).
RETRIEVE CLIMATOLOGICAL BASELINE
Retrieve the average historical maximum temperature (T_c) for the forecast date.
Retrieve the long-term standard deviation of max temperatures (σ_c) for that date.
Each forecast uses historical and recent data available up to the day before purchase.
FUSED TEMPERATURE CALCULATION
Calculate the fused mean maximum temperature (μₓ) using a precision-weighted average:
μₓ = (Tₚ / σₚ² + T_c / σ_c²) / (1 / σₚ² + 1 / σ_c²)
Calculate the fused standard deviation (σₓ) of the forecast distribution:
σₓ = √[1 / (1 / σₚ² + 1 / σ_c²)]
Sample a random value from the normal distribution N(μₓ, σₓ) to generate the forecast max temperature.
RAINFALL PROBABILITY AND AMOUNT
Retrieve the rainfall probability (P_r) for the forecast date.
P_r is based on the percentage of past days with similar or lower max temperatures that recorded more than 0 mm of rain.
Retrieve the expected rainfall amount (R_mm), based on the average rainfall on those matching rainy days.
OUTPUT AND DELIVERY
Format the forecast as follows:
Max Temp: e.g. 24.8°C
Rainfall: e.g. 74% chance of 8.8 mm
Display the forecast on-screen and send it to the user by email.

FORECAST MODEL
The Weather Ready model is a statistical-dynamical hybrid forecast model.
It combines historical climate data for the forecast date with the most recent maximum temperature.
The most recent temperature is taken from the last completed YearDay before the forecast date.
The model is a probabilistic ensemble-style simulation.
Because the model is probabilistic, there is no theoretical limit to the forecast range.
In practice, forecasts are limited to the time span for which this information is useful or needed.
The Weather Ready model is not a physical weather model like ECMWF or ACCESS-G.
The model does not output the long-term average maximum temperature.
The model incorporates climatic cycles into its forecasting calculations where statistically detectable.

WEATHER READY MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE FORECAST ACCURACY
Weather Ready forecasts are based on historical model performance.
Forecasts are probabilistic and not guaranteed.
Weather Ready aims for more than 50% of maximum temperature forecasts to be within ±2.8°C of the actual maximum temperature for the forecast date, regardless of lead time
For each maximum temperature forecast:
There is a 20% chance it is within ±1.0°C of the actual maximum.
There is a 39% chance it is within ±2.0°C.
There is a 54% chance it is within ±3.0°C.
There is a 67% chance it is within ±4.0°C.
There is a 76% chance it is within ±5.0°C.
There is an 84% chance it is within ±6.0°C.
There is an 89% chance it is within ±7.0°C.
There is a 92% chance it is within ±8.0°C.
There is a 95% chance it is within ±9.0°C.
There is a 96% chance it is within ±10.0°C.
There is a 99.99% chance it is within ±22.0°C.

WEATHER READY RAINFALL FORECAST ACCURACY
Rainfall is harder to forecast long range due to its binary and spatial variability.
Rainfall error is best expressed probabilistically, not as exact values.

ACCURACY STANDARDS USED BY CONVENTIONAL SHORT RANGE FORECASTING SERVICE PROVIDERS
Conventional short-term forecasts are different from Weather Ready long-range forecasts.
Conventional short-term forecasts have a lead time of less than 14 days.
They have no forecast skill beyond 14 days.
In practice, reliable detail is usually limited to the first 8–10 days.
At Day 7, short-term forecasts typically have an error of ±2°C.
At Day 10, the typical error increases to ±3–5°C.
At Day 14, the typical error is around ±5°C.

ACCURACY STANDARDS USED BY OTHER LONG RANGE FORECASTING SERVICE PROVIDERS
Long-term forecasts begin at lead times beyond 14 days.
Accuracy decreases as the lead time increases.
Providers use trend-based terms instead of specific temperatures.
An acceptable long-range forecast captures the overall pattern—not the exact value.
Long-range forecasts are treated as probabilistic scenarios, not precise predictions.

WEATHER READY VS OTHER PROVIDERS
Weather Ready provides date-specific forecasts for dates beyond 14 days.
Forecasts include a specific maximum temperature as a single best estimate.
Forecasts do not revert to seasonal averages beyond 14 days.
Forecasts use a structured probabilistic method.
Forecasts preserve realistic day-to-day maximum temperature variability.
Forecasts are generated using a statistical-dynamical hybrid model — not a physics-based NWP model.
The model runs ensemble-style simulations responsive to current climate variability.
Forecasts return clear, specific results.
Forecasts are delivered instantly via on-screen display and email.
No logins required.
No app downloads required.
Information is presented clearly.
No meteorological knowledge is needed.
Forecasts are more accurate than the average during variational weather events — when actual temperatures differ from historical averages.

PUBLIC DEMAND FOR LONG RANGE FORCASTING IN AUSTRALIA
There is strong demand for long-range, date-specific weather information in Australia. 
This demand is growing
people show curiosity about future weather, even where accuracy is low. 
people find value in long-range forecasts presented responsibly with proper caveats. 
people tend to be accepting of imprecision as long as it’s clearly communicated. 
people are willing to work with forecasts that fall within a reasonable error margin, 
people are willing to work with forecasts when framed probabilistically. 
people don’t expect perfection but prefer “some idea over no idea.” 
forecasts presented with quantified uncertainty hold more trust than specific predictions delivered with unjustified confidence.

SEASONAL PATTERNS AND TEMPERATURE PREDICTABILITY
Earth’s axial tilt and orbit around the Sun create consistent seasonal patterns.
These patterns determine how much solar energy each location receives on each day of the year.
As a result, each calendar day has a characteristic range of temperatures.
This range is defined by:
– The historical average (mean maximum temperature for that date)
– The standard deviation (how much temperatures usually vary on that date)
These values form the statistical basis for long-range forecasts.

SHORT-TERM ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS
Short-term atmospheric conditions vary from year to year, even when seasonal solar energy is consistent.
They drive daily weather variability.
They explain why the temperature on a given date can differ from the same date in another year.
Short-term atmospheric conditions include:
– Cloud cover
– Wind direction and speed
– Air pressure systems (such as highs and lows)
– Humidity levels
– The temperature of surrounding air masses
– Rainfall or storm activity
These factors are not predictable far in advance and are not included individually in long-range forecasts.

WEATHER READY VS AVERAGE
Weather Ready’s advantage over the average method in predicting extreme temperatures (cold and hot):
Weather Ready outperforms the historical average method in predicting both cold and hot days — showing improved accuracy at the extremes of variability.
Predicting Cold Days:
When the actual day was cold, Weather Ready correctly forecasted it 6.7% of the time.
The average method forecasted cold days correctly 0% of the time.
Predicting Hot and Very Hot Days:
Weather Ready correctly identified:
Hot days 12.6% of the time (vs 0% for average)
Very hot days 0.97% of the time (vs 0% for average)
The average method did not identify a single hot or very hot day directly.

FORECAST LIMITATIONS
Weather Ready long-range forecasts do not attempt to predict individual atmospheric factors such as cloud cover, wind, humidity, or rainfall events.
Instead, the model estimates the net effect of all short-term atmospheric conditions on the expected maximum temperature.
This approach allows the forecast to reflect typical variability without relying on precise predictions of specific weather elements.
