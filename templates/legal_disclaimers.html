  <h2>2. Nature of Services</h2>
  <p>The Services provided by Weather Ready consist of statistical estimations of future weather conditions for specific dates, generated using proprietary forecasting methodologies that integrate historical climatological data with recent observational trends.</p>

    <li>The availability or uninterrupted operation of the Services;</li>
    <li>The fitness of the Services for any particular purpose or use.</li>
