    <h1>Legal & Consumer Disclaimers</h1>
    <p>Weather Ready forecasts are generated using long-range statistical models that draw from historical climate data and recent temperature trends.</p>
    <p>These forecasts are informational only and should not be used as a basis for planning events, financial decisions, or safety-critical outcomes.</p>
    <p>Forecast results reflect statistical estimates with known uncertainty. Actual conditions may differ significantly from forecasted values.</p>
    <p>Forecasts are not guarantees. Users must evaluate forecast information independently.</p>

    <h2>This service complies with:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth)</li>
        <li>Australian Consumer Law (ACL)</li>
        <li>Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles</li>

    <p>No personal data is stored or sold by Weather Ready. Each forecast is a single-use snapshot generated using the best available data at the time of purchase.</p>

    <h2>Forecast Accuracy</h2>
    <p>Forecast accuracy is assessed by comparing the predicted maximum temperature to the actual maximum temperature recorded at the Perth Metro weather station (Station ID: 009225, Lat: -31.92, Lon: 115.87, Elevation: 24.9 m), as published by the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM). The ±3°C accuracy statement refers specifically to alignment with this official BOM observation point.</p>

    <p>All forecasts are based on observations from the Perth Metro weather station (Station ID: 009225, Lat: -31.92, Lon: 115.87, Elevation: 24.9 m), located in Kings Park. This station is considered representative of the central Perth metropolitan area, including suburbs such as Perth CBD, West Perth, East Perth, Northbridge, Subiaco, Leederville, Mount Lawley, South Perth, Victoria Park, and Burswood. Forecasts may not fully reflect conditions in outer suburbs, coastal zones, or hill districts.</p>
