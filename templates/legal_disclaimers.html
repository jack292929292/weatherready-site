    <h2>Forecast Accuracy Statement</h2>
    <p>Weather Ready forecasts are generated using long-range statistical models that draw from historical climate records and recent temperature trends specific to the Perth metropolitan area. These forecasts include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Expected maximum temperature</li>
        <li>Likely rainfall amount</li>
        <li>Rainfall probability (as a percentage)</li>
        <li>Confidence range (forecast error margin)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Forecast accuracy is evaluated by comparing predicted maximum temperatures to the actual recorded values at the Perth Metro weather station (Station ID: 009225, Lat: -31.92, Lon: 115.87, Elevation: 24.9 m), as reported by the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM). The ±3°C accuracy figure refers specifically to alignment with this official station.</p>
    <p>This station is representative of the central Perth metropolitan area, including suburbs such as Perth CBD, West Perth, East Perth, Northbridge, Subiaco, Leederville, Mount Lawley, South Perth, Victoria Park, and Burswood. Forecasts may be less reflective of conditions in outer metro areas, coastal zones, or elevated inland districts.</p>
